When you drag components onto the canvas, you'll now see:

### How to Use
1. Click and hold a component from the left panel
2. Watch as valid drop zones highlight
3. Move your mouse over the canvas
4. Release to drop the component
5. See the success message appear

### Tips

## 2. Template History & Recovery

### What Changed
Your template now automatically saves versions as you work, allowing you to:
- **Recover Old Versions**: Go back to any previous state
- **See File Sizes**: Understand how complex each version is
- **Track Changes**: Know exactly when changes were made

### How to Use

#### Accessing History
1. Look for the history icon in the toolbar (or use panel visibility settings)
2. Click to open the Template History panel
3. See all your previous versions listed

#### Restoring a Version
1. Open the history panel
2. Click on any previous version
3. Your template instantly reverts to that state
4. Keep the changes by continuing to work, or try another version

#### Understanding the Panel
- **Time**: When the version was saved (e.g., 2:45:30 PM)
- **File Size**: How large the template is (in KB)
- **Active Version**: The current version is highlighted in blue

### Tips
- Versions auto-save after every change (you don't need to do anything)
- Up to 20 versions are kept automatically
- Oldest versions are removed when you exceed the limit
- All version data is lost when you close the editor (it's session-based)
